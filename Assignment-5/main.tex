     \textbf{papoulis book exercise 2}\\
    \large \noindent Q-7 If S = \{1,2,3,4\}, find the smallest field that contains the sets \{1\} and \{2,3\}.
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Solution}

        I understand that with the field, I want to find the unions, intersections, complements, and then the empty set and S.
        
        Union is \{1,2,3\}.

        Intersection is \{\}.

        complement is \{4\}.

        empty set is \{\}.

        Sample space is \{1,2,3,4\}.

        The smallest required field: F=\{\{\}, \{1\}, \{4\}, \{1,4\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{1,2,3,4\}\}.
